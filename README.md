# Artificial Neural Network

Just a small python program that can create, train and test small, simple neural networks.
There is also a script to normalize the training/testing data sets.

The program uses the multi-layer perceptron neural network model and gradient descent back
propagation algorithm for supervised learning. The sigmoid function is used for the activation
function.
