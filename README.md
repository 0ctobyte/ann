# Artificial Neural Network

Just some small python programs that can create, train and test small, simple neural networks.
There is also a script to normalize the training/testing data sets.

`adaline.py` demonstrates the Adaline neuron model. It uses the Widrow-Hoff learning rule.

`mlp.py` uses the multi-layer perceptron neural network model and gradient descent back
propagation algorithm for supervised learning. The sigmoid function is used for the activation
function.

`perceptron.py` demonstrates the Perceptron neuron model.
